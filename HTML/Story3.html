        <h3>I Love My Ex</h3>
        <p id="mainstory">
            I Love My Ex-Husband
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In the evening, I busily walked on the road to go back to my hometown. Tomorrow was father's seventieth birthday, I had to go to help with the celebration. My husband was always never keen to let me go to my hometown to stay the night, after a fight, he finally allowed me to go. But the sky was turning dark, and he would not drive me. I thought of the Jiu Jie ditch, and how there had been so many incidents of women being taken advantage there, it made my heart panic. I really hope I can meet with someone I know and walk the Jiu Jie ditch with them.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            One road after another, there was no one to be seen in front of me. When I almost arrived at the Jiu Jie ditch, I looked back to see a man walk towards me. I could not help but get nervous and anxious, and walked faster, taking large steps, not even stopping to look behind me. That person walked even faster and was coming closer and closer to me. Finally, I realized that the person was the person I had been with three years prior for three years, my ex-husband. His house was behind us, where was he going at this hour? Why was he following me? I sped up, and he sped up, I slowed down, and he slowed down, always leaving around a 50-meter distance between us. It was like he was ready at any time to run towards me. Oh, was he the scoundrel? 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When I had broken up with three years ago, I had re-married, but he never re-married. I understood his temper was not good, and he was a very combustive person. But, at his core, he was still a good person, and I could not believe he would fall to these levels of depravity. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Jiu Jie ditch was a very curvy road, with high mountains and thick forests--it was the best place for a scoundrel. Once I was in the Jiu Jie Ditch, my fear had reached its peak. So, I walked as fast as I could, I had almost exhausted myself, my breath becoming laboured. My ex-husband was still following me, and this time it seemed like he was walking even faster toward me. For protection, I held a rock in my hand. It did not matter who it was, even if it were the ex-husband who I used to share a bed and pillow with, if they wanted to take advantage of me, I would not let him go.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Then I suddenly thought of how my ex-husband use to bully me, and even now he wanted to humiliate me, my heart filed with rage and my fear and anxiety disappeared. I decided I was going to question him, and I turned around and walked up to him.  I stood in front of him, and with in a large voice, I shouted "Why are you following me? what do you want to do?"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He hesitated and remained silent. I understood that in his heart, he wanted to do bad things, but he could not say it out loud. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I forcefully warned him "If you dare touch me, I will report you to the police," I raised the rock in my hand, and with a determined attitude, said "I will fight you, so you go first. Go far far away." 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He did not say a word, but with those thieving eyes looked me over, and very reluctantly went first. When he walked past the bend, and I could no longer see him, I finally let go of my breath, and threw away the stone in my hand and continued walking.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Before there was an "enemy" at my side, and I had to continued to be on high alert. Once I had chased away the "enemy", for a moment, I thought the mountain road was eerily silent. The wind blew, the sky continued to darken, and my heart became once again wracked with worry and fear. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What should have happened finally happened. I had thought chasing away my Ex-husband would mean that there would be no more worries, but who would have thought he would turn back and run at me. He really was going to do something to me, I became really scared, but then I realized that the shirtless person charging at me, was not my ex-husband. At this, I felt another depth of anxiety and fear, and my legs became soft and my hands sore. I could not run away from him anymore; I could only helplessly cry out "Help me!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When that scoundrel came to my side, his hands poised to hug and catch me, suddenly he then ran into the forest. It turned out that when my Ex-husband heard my cry for help, he ran backed and had yelled "Don't fear, I'm here!". The scoundrel had been scared of his shout and ran away. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I did not care for anything and ran towards my Ex-husband, falling towards his embrace.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I hope that he can hold me. due to the shock that I received, my whole body was shaking, and I needed a warm embrace and strong shoulders to protect me. When I was feeling completely safe and comfortable, I felt his sudden movement. He held me tightly, and then softly pushed me away. "Don't be like this!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He never stopped comforting me, telling me to not be scared. He then said, "You should walk in front of me" "No, let us walk together," I pleaded. A pervert had pushed me toward my Ex-husband's side, I cannot ever do such foolish things like pushing him away again.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We silently walked. I thought how if my ex-husband had not appeared, I would enduring a world of humiliation, and danger, and maybe I would have to put forth my life as the price. Remembering back to when I and him had lived together, those scenes, I found that most of those times, it was me who had blamed him wrongly, leading to me leaving him. Add on to the scenario that had shook me to my core, it made my heart be hard to still. A person that I had cursed and hated had saved me, shame and gratitude interwove together in my heart, I started to cry. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After walking out of the Jiu Jie Ditch, I could see, not far away, the village that my parents lived in. My ex-husband stopped and said to me "There won't be any more trouble now, slowly go now, I'll stand here and watch you go into the village before leaving!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I asked him "Don't you still have work to do?" 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He smiled and said, "Seeing you safely go out of Jiu Jie Ditch, I can consider my work to be done."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ah, it is too unexpected! I never would have thought he was here for the sole purpose of being with me and protecting me. His sincerity and honesty once again moved me. I said very sorrily, "I hurt you, but you still saved me, you really are a good person. I don't even know to repay you?"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He said: "As long as you don't see me as a bad person, that's enough."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Hearing him say that my heart became extremely uncomfortable, and I was too ashamed to face him. I once again sincerely apologized to him "I've wrongly blamed you. It was my fault as well in the past, wronging you and your mother. Please, don't put such things on your heart."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He said: "If I was such a vengeful person, I wouldn't walk with you through Jiu Jie Ditch. Recently, this road is not very peaceful, why didn't you ask for someone to walk with you?"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I knew the someone he was referring to be my husband. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How comical! My husband had been at ease with his cute wife to go and risk the danger of being attacked by a scoundrel, but my ex-husband had been willing to risk fighting with a scoundrel, to secretly protect his not cute at all ex-wife
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When I and him had said our goodbye's, he suddenly said, "Today is your father's 70th birthday right? You must be going back to celebrate with him. If it is convenient, please say some nice words to him for me. I wish his good health and long life!" 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In this world, to have a man remember his wife's birthday was already pretty good, but after so man years, he had remembered my father's birthday, and had even wished him good health? Why must he always move me so? 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I sincerely agreed to in his stead to wish my father well. But I could not, I will never be able to contact him again. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Some people "hate that they could not meet you (the right person) before marrying " but I "hate that I've only begun to know you after I've re-married."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Only after adversity could I see the truth! I will always be grateful and miss my ex-husband.
