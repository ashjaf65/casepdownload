            Passing By Jiu Ge Gao
            <br/>
            <br/>
            During the evening I saw a person walking down along a small path that diverges from the main road beside my village. Judging through the resemblance of her back view and through the way she walks it must be her. Yes, it is right. In the glow of sunset, I can see her clearly, it is her. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            3 years ago, she was my wife for 3 years. There was short time, where we would get into fights constantly over petty reasons. Over time I became very irritated with her. Her personality that refuses to admit wrongdoing led to divorce. Over the years I have never met her but through rumors I have heard that she has remarried. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I think she is returning to her mother’s house. If she is going to her mother’s house she must past by Jiu Ge Gao. Seeing that she is alone, I follow her. I keep a distance of 50 meters between us. She is walking as fast as possible. She even looks back every once in a while, looking panicked. She must have released who I am. The road is very curvy and every time she turns the corner, I lose sight of her because forests block my view.  After I lose sight, run to catch sight of her.  On the next turn I lose sight of her again and I run to catch up. However, when I reach the destination, I see her turned towards me and then she moves to stand in front of me. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She angerly asks “What do you want from me?”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It reminds me of our past of fighting because she is a tiger woman.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I do not want to talk to her about things. I stare at her notice little change over the years. She has gotten a little skinny though. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            “You look at me with malicious intent, you and I are strangers. I do not care how you are or who you are but today you cannot touch me. If you touch me, I will sue you. If you have something to do you should go ahead. Do not follow me.” 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She had a bad mood. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She thinks that I am a person that intends to humiliate her.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I walked in front of her. However, I continued look back. The distance between us widens. After turning the curve, I cannot see her.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After a little while, I hear a person shouting for help. Immediately ran towards the voice. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As I run, I shout “Do not be afraid I am coming”. I see to my front a half-naked man in front. After the man sees me, he runs into the forest. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She ran up to me, with a pale face and breathing heavily telling me “I was afraid to death”. I encouraged her telling her to be brave and that as long as I am here you do not have to be afraid. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I ask, “I think you should walk in the front.”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She responds, “No you should walk with me.”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We walked in silence. After approaching the end of the road, the area was dark. I can see her mothers house through forest of coconut trees.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I tell her that going forward now will be safe from here and I let her go alone from there. I stood their watching her go into the village. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She asks me “Don’t you have something to do?”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I responded “That my work is done. Have a good night.”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She grabs my hand saying that “I understand, you are the person that walks with me and protects me. You are my saviour. In my whole, I will never forget you. I was wrong about you. In the past there were times when I was not right. I am sorry to and to your mom. Forgive me.” She had red eyes. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            She finally admits wrongdoing. If she had admitted wrongdoing 3 years ago…
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Even if it is late, she said sorry, and I am very happy that she has learned.
