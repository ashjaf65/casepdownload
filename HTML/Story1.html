            What am I going to do?
        </h3>
        <p id="whatamigoingtodo">
        I sat beside the window of a tram and to my other side sat an old man from Lingao. I do not understand what the old man is trying to say to me. I do not even bother to speak because I am too tired of the car. I leave the tram and it is raining outside.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Yesterday I received a telegraph? A message? Something that said my mother is deathly sick and not long for this world. Last night I could not sleep. My mother’s sickness was because of me. Ever since I broke up with Li qui, I made my mother sick with fury. These 6 months she is sometimes sick and then sometimes better, and then sick again. Now she is so sick she cannot even get up from her bad. I fear that this trip to home will be the last time I see her.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I will always remember that one night during last year’s fall, I sat at the TV and waited to watch something (not sure). The program was filled with (something), and it showcased the care between people, something between friends, the truthful fortune and something desire. In the past, Qiu (his ex-girlfriend (would watch with me, but this time she in the provincial capital) participating in a business class for a month. I think at this time, she is also sitting by the TV.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then that night, the announcer, with their sweet and soft voice, that when I heard it, it sounded. I could not believe my ears, this kind of thing was too sudden, too shocking. That announcer said, “Li Qiu from XX company would like the sing “my special love for the special you” and would like the invite her boyfriend, the CEO of Tian Long Gong is to listen closely. This really was, that it made me faint. It was like this, a person that I thought was the warmest, most naive, politest, and kindest and most of all loved me the most was all of a sudden using the countries biggest media.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once my mother knew that me and Li Qiu had broken up, she was so angry that she would not eat, would not sleep. She scolded me for being dishonorable (like…suspicious and not duly focused on his girlfriend), and then she got sick. And even though after once she learned that everything had been Li Qiu’s plot, she still blamed me for being stupid. Qiu often came to my house, and always sweetly called my mother “mom” and never forgot to bring gifts to respect and honour her elders. Mother thought of her as her own daughter, and her leaving has really hurt my mother’s heart. In her sickness, my mother sometimes even called for her.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I can only complain in my heart, that I did not have the riches to keep Li Qiu’s attention. But if it is like this, then what she loved was money and not me. At Haikou district, when the market economy is being so emphasized, perhaps love has become another product. I heard that Li Qiu and that CEO met at a famous and upstate bar. The man was a Hong Kong businessman, 50 years old. That night Li Qiu had worn a luxury outfit, famous shoes, a gemstone encrusted ring, golden watch, golden bracelet, and a golden necklace etc. She made herself dazzling, enrapturing many. I heard that guy also for her specially, at that golden water flower garden bought her a villa and used it to hide her away. (Reference to 金屋藏娇 a folktale)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From my little sister’s message, in her sickness, my mother often asks if I have found another partner—always being concerned with the issue of my wedding. I really pity the mothers and fathers of the world, not only do they toil endlessly to raise their children up, but they also have to see their children grow their own families before they can rest in peace. My little sister said if I did have another partner then I should quickly go and see mother. She said once mother sees that, she will become happy and become well again. I know that my hometown had an old saying, which was “Chong Xi” —to do happy things in order to drive away sickness and misfortune. Even though it is all superstition, I hope I can get experience it too.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Like this my burden became large, because my mother’s sickness was because of me and only I cure her too. Is not this _. And I must fulfill one requirement and that was to have a woman, and it has been a woman who can be with me for the rest of my life. Is this easy?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My few co-workers once they learned of this were worried for me. Everyone all wanted to quickly introduce to me women. But none of them were right for me. Xiao (a form of endearment) Li said “the issue of your marriage is very important; I can’t help you right now. But your mother is so sick, you cannot drag this on. I remember there is a play called “rent a bride”, why don’t you rent a bride as well, fake dating one another to solve this pressing issues. Saving your mother takes priority.” Everyone said that this was a good idea, but where to rent one! What woman would allow herself to be rented? Xiao Li quickly thought of an idea, he said “what about renting a prostitute?” Everyone thought this was too out of the system.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When there really was no solution, I received the message of my mothers near death experience.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The tram calmly galloped through the asphalt road of 223, the trunk of the car slightly rumbled as we moved, letting me who was sitting in the back seat suddenly fall asleep. I do not know how much time had passed or how far we had gone, when from my sleep I thought I smelled faint perfume drifting my way, so comfortable.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then suddenly I heard a sound right by my ear, the car seemed to have stopped. I opened my eyes and saw that the tram had stopped at a vendor. Workers like worker bees swarmed the tram on all sides, raised their hands high holding bananas, coconuts, dragon fruit, and various fruits shouting for someone to buy them. I quickly woke up, shocked. The fellow who sat beside me before was gone, and now sitting by my side was a young woman. I had been using her shoulder to sleep for the ride. What was even more shocking was that the woman was Li Qiu Yan. I quickly woke up, shocked. The fellow who sat beside me before was gone, and now sitting by my side was a young woman. I had been using her shoulder to sleep for the ride. What was even more shocking was that the woman was Li Qiu Yan
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The world really is too small, so small that it allowed a pair of enemies to be in the same car and even allow them to be seated together. I do not even understand when she got on the car.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The car started again, and I had nowhere to run and could only awkwardly sit with her. My whole entire body feeling uncomfortable.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She smiled and asked me “I heard auntie is sick, I’ll go with you to see her together?”
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I dislike her, I hate her, I did not want to pay attention to her.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She then said, “auntie’s sickness was because of me. Really, there was no way, and I have wronged you all. What can I do to help you? “We are now strangers, and she could still say these words without shame. It made me so mad that I wanted to yell at her, but I decided to use silence against her. Silence was a form of the highest and truest contempt. The coldness I directed against her, she didn’t seem to mind, and continued to calmly say “I heard from Xiao Li that if you bring someone with you to see your mom there’s a chance she’ll get better. So, could I come with you to go see her?”
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This Xiao Li told her everything. I was never going to bring her back home. In my eyes there was no difference between her and a prostitute. Prostitutes sold their bodies, she sold her youth, it was all for money. What was different was that she was allowed herself to be “taken care” of by only one old man. I did not bring a prostitute because it wouldn’t have been proper, then how could I bring her, a hateful traitor home?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The tram finally arrived at the station for my hometown. I got off the tram, and I still needed to walk for a few meters before I got home. Suddenly a wave of fear overcame me. I was going to see my own mother bed-ridden, on her death bed mother, what if my mother asked me of my marriage plans? What was I going to say? could I make her worried even more, speeding her towards her death, to let her die without being at peace?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Ah, I was so stupid, so foolish! Why was I not brave enough to bring a prostitute home? I could pay her money; pretend she was a doctor coming to save my mother's life. It was not even for "taking care" of her, what was there that was "indecent"? I started to regret my decision. I lifted my heavy feet and started walking on the road to home.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Brother Xi, you're not going to bring me to see your mom? You can scold me, hate me, but you should think about your mother, right? Aren't you afraid that she will die?"
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Ah, Qiu Yan also got of the car. Is she really going to follow me home?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Her words were like knives, cutting me in my heart, shocking me. I stood down.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She continued on, "I'm sorry, it was me who hurt you and your mother. If something happens to her, I will feel very uneasy. Our relationship is already cannot go back to what it once was, but for your mother's life, don't you want to for a moment forget about the hate you have towards me and let us smile and go meet your mother?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Hearing her words, I could not help but sink into deep thought.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We lost real love, making my mother sick, and now we were going to use fake love to rescue her life, wasn't this very comical? However, what on this earth was more important than a mother, more precious than her life!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When I have lost all other solutions to save my mother's life, the only solution left was this one, and it was the only choice. Perhaps my most hated person, would be enough the save my most loved mother's life!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Li Qiu Yan stood in front of me, we looked into each other's eyes and walked on the wrong road towards the ending pairs of life and death and love and death. Who can tell me, right now, what should I do?
