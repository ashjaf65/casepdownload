            <h3>The Rose with Thorns</h3>
            <p id="rosewiththorns">
            When I got off of my bicycle, for a moment, I left this world. When I woke up, the world was so beautiful: I lay in a snow-white room, and in front of my hospital bed stood a handsome fellow. The nurse told me; it was he who took me to the hospital. I asked for his last name, and where he worked, but he kept silent, only smiling softly at me.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He comforted me, saying that my injuries were not too bad and very quickly I would be discharged. Then, he asked me for my house number and address, to call my father and mother, and then he left. On the third day, at noon, when I woke up, on the desk beside the bed was a fresh red rose.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "When that fellow came, you were asleep" the nurse told me.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I held the flower. The thorns pricked people, but the flower smelled nice. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "there's a note in the stem," the nurse pointed out. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I carefully opened the white note. It said, "I wish you a swift recovery!" One rose, one phrase, it made me feel so happy, so warm, and it evoked a thousand words in my heart. I did not know the name of the person, but you let me miss you so much ah!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            When I was discharged, the doctor wanted me to go home and rest for a few days. One afternoon, when my parents were at work, I sat at the living room watching videos, the doorbell sounded. I went to open the door, and there stood a young man wearing a suit, holding a fire-red rose.
            <br/>
            <br/> 
            It was him! I was pleasantly surprised. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "Lady Chen, I'm very happy to see that you've made a full recovery!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            he very politely gave me the fresh flower.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Our hands were tightly clasped together. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I was really happy, and also a little nervous. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I invited him into the living room to sit, and busily prepared the best eat, in order to accommodate this precious guest. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "It's alright, you don't have do all that, I still have to quickly catch a plane to Guang Zhou. I just wanted to see you while on the way to the airport."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            He was going to go, I was a little disappointed. I thought he must have a very cozy job. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I said to him "If you don't tell me your name, I won't let you go," he saved me, in this lifetime, I want to never forget him. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "My last name is Xu, and I work in foreign trade. You can call me Sir Xu."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "No, I'm not use to it, you also don't have to call me Lady Chen. I'll just call you brother Xu, okay?"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "Okay, to have a sister like you really is my fortune." he laughed. "Your cassette player is from Sony, it's very good. This time when I go to Guang Zhou, I'll buy you a good movie cassette for sure."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "When are you coming back?"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "In around a week."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "I'll wait for your return, you have to come to my house, my parents really want to meet you!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            the days passed as if they were years. Waiting for someone was really frustrating. When he just left, I already was calculating when he would return. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But what was even more frustrating was that our family the "Sony" was robbed. When I thought of the cassette tape that Brother Xu was going to bring back, I felt so sad.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Our hands were tightly clasped together. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I was really happy, and also a little nervous. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I invited him into the living room to sit, and busily prepared the best eat, in order to accommodate this precious guest.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            "No, I'm not use to it, you also don't have to call me Lady Chen. I'll just call you brother Xu, okay?"

            <br/>
            <br/>
            "In around a week."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "I'll wait for your return, you have to come to my house, my parents really want to meet you!"
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The days passed as if they were years. Waiting for someone was really frustrating. When he just left, I already was calculating when he would return. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            But, what was even more frustrating was that our family the "Sony" was robbed. When I thought of the cassette tape that Brother Xu was going to bring back, I felt so sad.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Finally, the day for when brother Xu was going to come back came. Early in the morning, my parents went to the market to buy groceries. They bought back chicken, duck, fish and meat, as well as many fresh vegetables and fruits. We as a family very happily waited for the arrival of brother Xu.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My parents said he was my savior. My feelings for him were even deeper than that. Today, when my parents would meet and as long as they were happy, him and I would have a beautiful love. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What was even more fortunate was that we had just received a message, that said that there was a breakthrough, and they wanted us to go to the police station to take back our stolen "Sony". The police really couldn't have chosen a better time, now when Brother Xu came, we could all watch the new movie. I went with my father to the police station.
            <br/>
            <br/> 
            At the station, I almost fainted. Because when I took a step over the big door, I saw that the culprit wearing handcuffs, sitting in the corner, was him! Brother Xu! no, it was sir Xu!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My tears blurred my vision, but still I could clearly see my family's Sony on the table, and that thorn bearing rose.
